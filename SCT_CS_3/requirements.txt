# 🔐 SCT_CS_3 – Advanced Password Strength Checker

This project is part of my Cyber Security Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.

## 📌 Overview
A Python CLI tool that evaluates **password strength** using:
- Length
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Digits
- Special characters
- Entropy (bits of security)

It categorizes a password as **Weak, Medium, or Strong** and provides actionable suggestions.
